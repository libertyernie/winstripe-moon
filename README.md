# Winstripe Moon
![Preview](https://github.com/libertyernie/winstripe-moon/blob/master/src/preview.png)
Pale Moon version of the [Winstripe (Firefox 1.x) theme](http://kmgerich.com/2006/08/05/firefox-1x-classic-themes-available/)

Originally based on [Fox 2 The Moon](https://github.com/Lootyhoof/fox2themoon), some icons are taken from that theme if Winstripe does not have an equivalent.
